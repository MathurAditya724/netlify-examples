# Rewrite with Netlify Edge Functions

You can rewrite requests on one URL to resources available on another URL using an Edge Function.

## Code example

Edge Functions are files held in the `netlify/edge-functions` directory.

```ts
import type { Context } from "netlify:edge";

export default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {
  return context.rewrite("/something-to-serve-with-a-rewrite");
};
```
